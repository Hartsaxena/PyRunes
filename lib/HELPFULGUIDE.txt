This is a short guide to including packages in your Portable Python.

If there is a zip file called python37.zip, extract it and put all the contents of the folder into the python3.7 folder. If you plan on adding packages or modules, you can delete the python37.zip file.

Use the command:

pip3 install [name of module] --target [path to site-packages]

You should find site-packages in the python3.7 folder.

Then, you can compress everything in the python3.7 folder and call the zip file "python37.zip"
EXCEPT for lib-dynload and plat-darwin

At this point, you should be done and can run the python3.7 Executable file and import your modules.
