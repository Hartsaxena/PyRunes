# PyRunes
 A Simple Program that allows you to store, create, and view League of Legends Runepages without having to pay 6300 BE!

This program was coded using Python version 3.7.7, and any other version has not been tested (and probably won't be tested in the future). Run at your own risk!
I'm really not sure if I will continue the development of this project, as I'm constantly moving on to other things. I program these little projects I think of and then i move on to the next idea. I'm pretty sure no one will ever read this, but if you are reading this, then I appreciate your time. Have a great day! :D


if you don't have the inflect module installed, you can either run:

pip3 install inflect

or

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

If you're like normal people.
